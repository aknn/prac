<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

## Time Series Analysis Course Overview

This repository contains my work and notes for a comprehensive course on Time Series Analysis. The course is designed to provide students with both theoretical knowledge and practical skills in applying time series models to fisheries and environmental data. 

### Course Content

The curriculum includes, but is not limited to, the following topics:
- Autocorrelation and Crosscorrelation
- Autoregressive (AR) and Moving Average (MA) Models
- Univariate and Multivariate State-Space Models
- Parameter Estimation Techniques
- Model Performance Assessment
- Model Diagnostic Evaluation

While the primary focus is on time-domain methods, the course also introduces frequency-domain techniques, albeit briefly. The overall emphasis of the course is on conceptualizing analyses, carrying out the analyses practically, and interpreting the results to make informed inferences.

### Practical Exercises

As part of the learning process, I am actively engaging with practical examples and exercises. For hands-on experience and to enhance my understanding, I follow along with instructional videos available on the SAFS Time Series YouTube channel. These videos are instrumental in demonstrating the application of theoretical concepts to real-world time series problems.

You can explore the video resources that I have been using here: [SAFS Time Series on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@SAFSTimeSeries)

### Implementation

In this repository, I document my progress through the course, including the implementation of various time series models and analyses. Each directory within the repository corresponds to a specific topic or assignment from the course, showcasing the practical application of the skills I've acquired.
