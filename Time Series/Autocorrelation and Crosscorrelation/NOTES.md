## White Noise Autocorrelation
White noise has a theoretical ACF where all lags are zero except for lag 0 (which is 1 due to normalization). However, due to random variations, you will see small non-zero values at different lags in the plot, which should not be significant and should not show any pattern as illustrated below:
