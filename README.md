# Practice Projects - Anil Kumar

Practice repository (`prac`) contains a variety of coding exercises and notes, primarily focusing on problem-solving, statistics, algorithm optimization, and exploring different programming languages and technologies.

## Structure

The repository is organized into different directories and files, each representing a unique set of problems or a specific programming language I've worked with.

## Content Overview
- `Time_Series/`: This directory contains my notes and Python programs from a Time Series Analysis course. It's a combination of theoretical concepts and practical applications using Python libraries.
- `Python Bytes/`: A collection of my solutions to problems from LeetCode. These solutions are implemented in Python and are a part of my coding practice to improve my data structures and algorithms knowledge.

## Installation and Usage

To run any of the practice programs, clone the repository to your local machine and navigate to the desired subdirectory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aknn/prac.git  
cd prac
